JAVA BASIC CONCEPTS:
	platform independent
	object-oriented: encapsulated objects that interact with one another, shift in thinking
	
	Development Cycle:
		compile source code files (.java) -> text bytecode (JVM takes bytecode files and interpret them)
			applications distributed using Java archive with .jar extension
	JDK:
		single software package, collection of Java development tools, oracle.com
		Java compiler javac, Java Archiving tool jar, Java debugging tool jdb, JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
		download and install, set PATH variable to bin, javac in command prompt
	JVM:
		translation dictionary for object files with .class extension, translates it to machine code
	Running a Java program:
		Every Java program has at least one Java class
		refer to java11.java "Hello World" program -> javac java11.java to compile it to class file
			run it by doing java java11
	Creating a project using Eclipse:
		work with eclipse, create new project, add new class to src file, run it
			can see exceptions/bugs in console
	Hello World Program:
		need a class in program, create public static void main method
		get user input by using Scanner
	Java doc style comments: /** * */
