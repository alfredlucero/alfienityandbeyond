BENTO WEB FUNDAMENTALS:

History of the Internet:
	Batch Processiing -> Time-Sharing with Multiple Users
	Scientific, Military, Commercial Networks
		ARPANET - IMP Subnets, Transmission Control Protocol, Distributed Network
		NPL - Packet-Switching
		Cyclades - inter-net, transfer nodes
	TCP/IP Protocols -> Internet
	
What is the Internet, really?
	Physical cables everywhere under seas and underground connect us all

How the Internet Works in 5 Minutes
	Clients are not connected directly to the internet but to Internet Service Provider
		ISP have servers connected directly to internet (wire)
		IP addresses, packets, routers shuttle packets of information across the internet

DNS Explained
	Domain Name System: www.google.com. (dot = root of DNS namespace)
		determine IP address based off of domain name alias
		queries resolving name server to find IP addresses
		resolving name server -> root server -> top-level domain servers -> authoritative name servers
		. -> .com. -> example.com. -> www.example.com.

20 Things I Learned About Browsers & The Web
	What is the Internet?
		packets, bandwidth, TCP/IP
	Cloud Computing
		data safely residing on the web, plugging into computers that serve info., Internet
	Web Apps: "Life, Libery, and the Pursuit of Appiness"
		access data from anywhere, latest version updated automatically, works on every device with web browser, safer
	HTML, JAVASCRIPT, CSS AND MORE
		HTML: structures and presents content on web page
		JAVASCRIPT: scripting language, real-time interactions
		XHR: dynamic web with XMLHttpRequest, parts of web page altered without needing to reload entire page -> faster, responsive
		CSS: layout and beautify page with design elements (CSS3)
		AJAX: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
	HTML5:
		<video>, offline capabilities, drag-and-drop
	3D IN THE BROWSER:
		open web technologies WebGL, 3D CSS
	A BROWSER MADRIGAL:
		old browsers vulnerable to attacks, web evolves quickly, slow
	PLUG-INS:
		an additional piece of software that specializes in processing particular types of content 
		i.e. Adobe Flash Player for games/video
	BROWSER EXTENSIONS:
		extensions written  in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS
	SYNCHRONIZING THE BROWSER:
		sync lets you save your browser settings online in the cloud
	BROWSER COOKIES:
		memory of visits, small piece of text sent to your browser by a website  you visit 
		"session-only cookies", permanent cookies
	BROWSERS AND PRIVACY:
		browser data, private/incognito modes, browser cookies
	MALWARE, PHISHING, AND SECURITY RISKS:
		phishing - someone masquerades as someone else with a fake website to get you to share personal information
		malware - malicious software installed on your machine, usually without your knowledge
	HOW MODERN BROWSERS HELP PROTECT YOU FROM MALWARE AND PHISHING:
		limits how often you come into contact with an attacker (i.e. Google Chrome Safe Browsing technology)
		limits how vulnerable your browser is if it's attacked (auto-updated)
		limits how much damage is done if an attacker finds vulnerabilities in your browser ("sandbox" layer of protection)
	USING WEB ADDRESSES TO STAY SAFE:
		Uniform Resource Locator (URL): web address typed into browser to get to a particular web page or web app
		http(scheme)://www.google.com(hostname)/maps(path)
		safe: https://www.bankofamerica.com
	IP ADDRESSES AND DNS:
		IP (Internet Protocol): series of numbers that tells us where a particular device is on the Internet network
		DNS ("phone book" of the Web): translates a URL/web address into the right IP address to contact
	VALIDATING IDENTITIES ONLINE:
		extended validation certificate - tells you name of the organization that runs the website
	EVOLVING TO A FASTER WEB:
		images and photos take up about 65% of information on typical web page, 35 hours of video, larger JS programs
		WebP compression techniques, Google Chrome's V8 JS engine, DNS pre-resolution
	OPEN SOURCE AND BROWSERS:
		"open source" - inner workings of a software are made available to all, and the software is written in an open, collaborative way
		i.e. Google Chrome built from parts of Mozilla Firefox and with open-source rendering engine WebKit
