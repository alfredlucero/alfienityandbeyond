BASIC CONCEPTS:

	database: collection of information that is organized in a manner that facilitates ease of access
			as well as efficient management and updating
			made up of tables that store relevant information
				columns and rows format i.e. first,last, phone #
				primary key is a filed in table that uniquely identifies the table records
					(unique column) contain a unique value for each row, cannot contain NULL values
					tables are limited to one primary key each (different key value per row)
	
	SQL: Structured Query Language
		used to access and manipulate a database
		MySQL is a program that understands SQL
		can insert, update, or delete records in a database
		can create new databases, tables, stored procedures, views
		can retrieve data from a database
	
	Basic Commands: SQL is case insensitive but commands typically in upper-case
		SHOW DATABASES: lists out databases
		SHOW TABLES: display all tables in currently selected database
		SHOW COLUMNS FROM table:
			Field - column name
			Type - column data type
			Key - indicates whether column is indexed
			Default - default value assigned to the column
			Extra - may contain any additional information that is available about a given column
		
		SELECT: select data from a database, result is stored in a result table = result-set
			query may retrieve information from selected columns or from all columns in the table
			SELECT column_list FROM table_name
				i.e. SELECT FirstName FROM customers;
			can run multiple queries or commands at the same time
			i.e.
			SELECT FirstName, LastName, City
			FROM customers;
			retrieve all information contained in table by placing *
				i.e. SELECT * FROM customers;
			DISTINCT: return unique records rather than fetching duplicates
				i.e. SELECT DISTINCT City FROM customers;
			LIMIT: allows us to return a subset of records
				i.e. SELECT column_list
					 FROM table_name
					 LIMIT [number of records];
				SELECT ID, FirstName, LastName, City
				FROM customers LIMIT 5; // retrieves first five records from customers table
							   LIMIT 3,4; // starts from third position and retrieves 4 records
			SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY FirstName // arranges by ascending order
				SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY LastName, Age; // order by multiple columns
			
			
	
	Syntax:
		single SQL statement can be placed on one or more text lines; multiple SQL statements can be combined on a single text line
		white spaces and multiple lines are ignored in SQL
		syntactic sugar:
			SELECT City FROM customers;
			SELECT customers.City FROM customers;
